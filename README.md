About Dataset
numcol: Number of honey-producing colonies. Honey-producing colonies are the maximum number of colonies from which honey was taken during the year. It is possible to take honey from colonies that did not survive the entire year
yieldpercol: Honey yield per colony. Unit is pounds
totalprod: Total production (numcol x yieldpercol). Unit is pounds
stocks: Refers to stocks held by producers. Unit is pounds
priceperlb: Refers to the average price per pound based on expanded sales. Unit is dollars.
prodvalue: Value of production (totalprod x priceperlb). Unit is dollars.
Other useful information: Certain states are excluded every year (ex. CT) to avoid disclosing data for individual operations. Due to rounding, total colonies multiplied by total yield may not equal production. Also, the summation of states will not equal the U.S. level value of production.
